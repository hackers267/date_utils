# DateUtils 

The date_utils is a package with a set of functions that operate on the date.**Date-Utils** is a powerful date and time manipulation library for Rust that relies on the well-known `chrono` library. Inspired by JavaScript's `date-fns`, this library aims to provide Rust developers with a rich set of features and an intuitive API.

Key features include:
1. Dependency on `chrono` for comprehensive and precise date and time handling capabilities.
2. A wide range of date and time operations such as addition, subtraction, formatting, parsing, comparison, adjustments, and utility functions.
3. High performance through optimized internal implementation and support from `chrono`.
4. Easy to use with a clear and consistent API design for rapid onboarding and efficient development.
5. Compatibility with ISO 8601 standards and support for time zone-related operations.

To get started, add the dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
date-utils = "0.1"
chrono = "0.4"
```

Then, import and use the library in your Rust code:

```rust
use date_utils::{DateUtils, FormatItem};
use chrono::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let now: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now();
    let formatted_date = DateUtils::format(now, &[FormatItem::Year, FormatItem::Month, FormatItem::Day]);
    println!("Today's date is: {}", formatted_date);
}
```

Detailed API documentation and usage examples can be found in the project's [official documentation](https://date-utils.github.io/docs/).

Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for new features, please submit an issue or pull request.
